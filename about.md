# a bit about me

My name is Nate Stringham and I'm a recent grad from Pomona College and budding machine learning researcher. I'm particularly interested in natural language processing for underserved and low-resource languages. Progress in these languages requires more theoretical work to address issues such as model robustness and sample efficiency while also presenting many applications to areas such as social science and the humanities. Big picture, I'm interested in how NLP for these domains relates to broader themes of fairness and ethics in AI. 

At Pomona I was also a distance runner <i class="material-icons run">directions_run</i> and captain on the [Cross Country](https://www.sagehens.com/sports/mxc/index) and [Track and Field](https://www.sagehens.com/sports/mtrack/index) teams. For the moment I've put competitive running on hold, but still enjoy being active outdoors. During my free time you can find me exploring (either on foot or on skis) the [Wasatch Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasatch_Range).
