# a bit about me

My name is Nate Stringham and I'm a recent grad from Pomona College and budding machine learning researcher. I'm particularly interested in natural language processing and its applications to underserved and low-resource domains such as multilingual, historical, and diachronic. I'm also interested in how these types of domains relate to broader themes of fairness and ethics in AI. 

At Pomona I was also a distance runner and captain on the [Cross Country](https://www.sagehens.com/sports/mxc/index) and [Track and Field](https://www.sagehens.com/sports/mtrack/index) teams. For the moment I've put competitive running on hold, but still enjoy being active outdoors. During my free time you can find me exploring (either on foot or on skis) the [Wasatch Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasatch_Range), reading, and most recently learning to play guitar.
